## Title 
To study and understand the behaviour of Federated Learning using GMMs

## Description
Traditional machine learning approaches require centralizing the training data on a single machine or in a data center. This process has a disadvantage in terms of privacy or data of users who provide the training data. All this data is directly visible to one central entity that collected it. Also, all the data is stored at a single location where the model will be trained therefore there is a chance of a single point of failure due to data loss or theft, hazard, natural disaster, etc... also in terms of an organization; this is expensive; maintaining and running the data-centre for 24 X 7. So, to solve this problem, a new form of machine learning technique is evolved called Federated learning. Federated Learning enables edge devices to collaboratively learn a shared prediction model while keeping all the training data on the device, decoupling the ability to do machine learning from the need to store the data in the cloud.
